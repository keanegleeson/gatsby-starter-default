<h1> Code Louisville Project </h1>

- This project is a demonstration of the knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript that I have learned as a result of taking the front end code Louisville course. It serves as a resume page and will be accessible at keanegleeson.com.

- TBD

- As far as I know, there should me no special instructions to run this project other than previewing the code or simply visiting keanegleeson.com!
